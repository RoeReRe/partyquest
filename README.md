# Party Quest
Party Quest is a 2D Multiplayer Table-Top RPG that can be played locally or over the Internet. A player will host the game on a PC and others can connect and control their characters using their mobile phones.

Players will work together to navigate different scenarios and fight intense active-time based battles.

## Notice
As a result of [Unity's Runtime Fee Program](https://unity.com/pricing-updates), this project will cease further development on the **Unity** engine with immediate effect.
**There are plans to develop the game on Godot (coming soon).**
